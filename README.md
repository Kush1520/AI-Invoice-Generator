## Features
 
- **AI Invoice Generation** — describe an invoice in plain text ("Invoice for John Smith at Acme Corp for 10 hours of web design at $150/hour, due in 30 days") and have it parsed into a structured invoice automatically.
- **AI Payment Reminders** — generate professional, personalized reminder emails for overdue or upcoming payments in one click.
- **AI Dashboard Insights** — data-driven, plain-English insights about revenue, collection rate, overdue invoices, and top clients, computed from real invoice data.
- **Recurring Invoices** — set up monthly/yearly recurring billing per client, with pause, resume, and cancel controls, powered by a scheduled cron job.
- **PDF Export** — download any invoice as a polished PDF.
- **Authentication** — secure JWT-based auth with protected routes.
- **Responsive UI** — built with Tailwind CSS and Framer Motion for smooth, modern interactions.

## Getting Started
 
### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- A MongoDB Atlas connection string
- A [Groq API key](https://console.groq.com/keys)
### 1. Clone the repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/AvinashGhai/AI-Powered-Invoice-Generator.git
cd AI-Powered-Invoice-Generator
```
 
### 2. Backend setup
```bash
cd backend
npm install
```
 
Create a `.env` file inside `backend/`:
```env
PORT=8000
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key
```
 
Run the backend:
```bash
nodemon server.js
```
 
### 3. Frontend setup
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```
 
The app should now be running locally, with the frontend on Vite's default port and the backend on `PORT` from your `.env`.
